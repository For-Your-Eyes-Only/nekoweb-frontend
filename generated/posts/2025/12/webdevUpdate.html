<p>So I was under the impression that if I wanted to update my site immediately without importing a zip everytime I'd need to use nekoGit and subscribe monthly. Turns out theres an API with all sorts of nice features. That means I can post like this and have the post up in a matter of minutes. Thank god. Oh also dont forget to subscribe to my RSS feed, so you can see quality content like this.</p>
