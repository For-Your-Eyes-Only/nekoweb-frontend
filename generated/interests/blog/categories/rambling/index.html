                <p>Little life update thing I suppose. I've started the process of working on the art for Millenium. I'm working with a pixel artist named Siang. They do incredible work. I wish I could share their stuff but their portfolio is private for now. I've also began playing a hacking <a href="pwnable.kr">CTF game</a> about reversing binarys on Linux servers. This has forced me to learn assembly x86 for intel architecture. Its about time. In the complete opposite direction of abstraction, I've been drilling leetcode for TypeScript as well. The job market really seems to favor high level coding so I want to reach a comfortable point with Typescript, plus I already use it for this website. Finally, I've been taking drum lessons to try and recover my wrist which has been suffering the last month and a half whenever I drum. All in all, life has gotten busy, but a good kinda busy.</p>

                <p>Super hyped thats over with. My job paid me to go get the cert and it was stressing me out. I'm so happy to say I'm passed and can stop worrying about it.</p>

                <p>So I was under the impression that if I wanted to update my site immediately without importing a zip everytime I'd need to use nekoGit and subscribe monthly. Turns out theres an API with all sorts of nice features. That means I can post like this and have the post up in a matter of minutes. Thank god. Oh also dont forget to subscribe to my RSS feed, so you can see quality content like this.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Learning Japanese has been tough. I might be going the hard route of wanting to know how to read all the Kanji for the N5 Vocabulary before moving on but I think it'll heavily benefit me.</p>
<p>Things are going well with Millenium, my TTRPG. I'm very close to having all the pages cleaned up. I've also finished writing up the first five out of ten levels of progression. Hopefully it sticks after playtesting. I'd like to release an open beta soon.</p>
<p>Oh also, I've developed some sorta wrist pain from my day job + drumming. I really do not want to give up drumming so I'm looking for solutions.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I got my girlfriend to try building her own site on Nekoweb and she's hooked! I can't wait to add her to my webring!</p>
